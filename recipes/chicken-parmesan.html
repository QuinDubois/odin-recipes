    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken Parmesan is a wonderful breaded chicken recipe topped with a red sauce and cheese. Kind of like a chicken pizza, it is warm,  indulgent, and fairly simple to make.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup panko bread crumbs, use more as needed</li>
        <li>3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, use more as needed</li>
        <li>1/2 cup olive oil for frying, or as needed</li>
        <li>1/2 cup tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 cup fresh cubed mozzarella</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated provolone cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh basil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C)</li>
        <li>Place chicken breasts inside a resealable plastic bag on a level surface. Firmly pound chicken with a smooth meat mallet until it is 1/2 inch thick.</li>
        <li>Season chicken with salt and pepper. Evenly coat both sides of the chicken breasts with sifted flour.</li>
        <li>Beat eggs in a shallow bowl. Mix panko and 1/2 cup parmesan cheese in a separate bowl. Dip seasoned chicken in the eggs, and then transfer the breast to the bread crumbs, coating both sides. Repeat for all chicken breasts. Let chicken rest for 10-15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat 1/2 inch olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat until it simmers. Cook chicken for about 2 minutes on each side, until golden brown. Cooking will finish in the oven.</li>
        <li>Transfer chicken to a wide baking dish and top with tomato sauce. Layer equal amounts of mozzarella and provolone cheese on top. Sprinkle basil and parmesan cheese on top. Drizzle with olive oil.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven until chicken is fully cooked and cheese is brown and bubbly, about 15-20 minutes. A kitchen thermometer should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C) when inserted into the center of the chicken breasts.</li>
    </ol>
