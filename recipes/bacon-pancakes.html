    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Like Jake the Dog, we're gonna be makin' bacon pancakes! Two great breakfast foods combined in an - you guessed it - indulgent sweet and savory meal.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 slices of bacon</li>
        <li>1 cup pancake mix</li>
        <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable or avocado oil</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>maple syrup, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook bacon in a large cast iron or nonstick skillet over medium-heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned. About 10 minutes. Drain bacon on paper towels.</li>
        <li>Combine baking mix, oil, milk, egg, and cinnamon in a bowl with a whisk until smooth. Mix two crumbled slices of bacon into batter.</li>
        <li>Heat non-stick skillet to medium-low heat. Cut bacon slices in half and lay two half slices into the pan. Pour batter over each half slice until covered.</li>
        <li>Cook until bubbles appear on the pancake batter. Flip and cook until golden brown. Repeat with the rest of the bacon and pancake batter.</li>
        <li>Serve with maple syrup and leftover bacon.</li>
    </ol>
