    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Icebox cake is an easy to make, and indulgent chilled dessert. It comes together in mere minutes, but it is best made a day in advance as it has to chill in the refrigerator for many hours before it is best served.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>1/2 cup confectioners' sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 1/2 (13.1oz) packages of Oreo Thins or equivalent alternative</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Line an 8x4 inch loaf pan with plastic wrap, leaving some excess over the sides.</li>
        <li>Put cream in a large bowl and beat with an electric mixer on medium speed for 2 minutes. Add sugar and vanilla extract; continue to beat until soft-medium peaks form. Reserve 1 cup of cream and refrigerate until use.</li>
        <li>Place a thin layer of whipped cream into the bottom of the loaf pan. Place a layer of cookies on top, filling in gaps with broken cookies. Layer 1/4 of whipped cream on top. Repeat until pan is full or cream is used, finishing with a layer of cookies. Wrap with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 8 hours.</li>
        <li>When serving, unwrap and invert cake onto a plate. Top with reserved cream and crushed cookies. Serve in slices!</li>
    </ol>
